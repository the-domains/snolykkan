# PIMP MY SKIING

Wondered how skiing felt like when you where a kid? Have you thought about when skiing took a different turn and wasn't as fun or gave you the same kind of sensation as it used to do? Have you ever wondered why?

Dealing with injuries and periods with lack of motivation affects our possibility to maximize the moment of skiing down a mountain. Equipment, friends, weather and environment plays definitely a big role in this game but pain, endurance, strength, flexibility and the all combined balance as well as progress in skiing is probably the most significant factors that set limits to having the most awesome day on the mountain and maintain passion and keep on skiing with the biggest smile!

> You can't treat the condition, you have to change it - Michael Jansson

Pimp My Skiing(c) is an extension of Michael Janssons Pimp My body(c) treatment protocol and aim to increase performance in every aspect of your skiing. The customized batch of physical tests highlights body functions used in skiing. The initial batch of physical test benchmark your current physical status, then you receive 4 treatments by Jansson's PMB protocol and finally we test you again so you can see, feel and be sure that change and improvement is awesome. 

Pimp My Skiing directs all people hitting a wall in development, in pain or want to somewhat restore function of "lost" body parts.
