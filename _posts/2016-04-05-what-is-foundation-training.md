# What is Foundation Training? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9059ed3d-94c4-406d-b399-bdf302bf09f7.jpg)

**Foundation Training is a series of exercises based on integrating the muscular chains of 
the body. Our exercises begin with the Posterior Chain of Muscles to quickly stabilize your 
spine and core because our modern lifestyles leave most of these muscles weak and 
imbalanced. **

You can quickly learn the tools you need to fix many of the chronic pains 
plaguing our daily lives. Learning to connect the Posterior Chain will teach you to move 
naturally, evenly absorbing the weight of your body. 

Once you begin to move properly you 
will engage more muscles in every step you take, sport you play, and exercise you choose 
to do. All ages and fitness abilities can benefit from Foundation Training because it teaches 
your body to move as nature intended. You will reach new heights in physical health and 
feel improved control of your body.

> "Strengthen your posterior chain and watch how
> your life changes."
