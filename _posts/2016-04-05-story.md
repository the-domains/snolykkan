## Why does the world need us?

**Part One**

The 27th of July, I made a search on Instagram to find out about the general interest of \#taggin' winter activities in a country.The purpose of the search was to highlight the fact that winter and skiing in Norway is important to many people in general.

The result showed that  all time winners of most skimedals by population size (NORWAY) in the Winter Olympics alsoare dominant of \#tagging the winter of their country \#winterinnorway. Surprisingly the swedes only post the \#winterinsweden half as much and the list goes on and down to countries like India with a big population only \#winterinindia 191 times.

When looking at these numbers, wealth, language use and the use of smartphones with the Instagram-app is off course also to be considered. However, in many ways it paints a pretty good picture of peoples relation to winter and what people like to post and whats on peoples mind.
