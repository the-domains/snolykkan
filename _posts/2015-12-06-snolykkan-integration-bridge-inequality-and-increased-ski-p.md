# SNØLYKKAN - Integration, bridge inequality & increased ski-performance

**The association SNØLYKKAN is a co-lab between ski-teachers with a drive and passion to share experiences on and off the snow. In the longterm we strive to stimulate integration in Norway, bridge inequality between people and inspire to live fully as humans.**
