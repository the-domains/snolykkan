## Maximize your experience, release your emotions and unplug from chronic pain and low functionality on and off snow.

**Wondered how skiing felt like when you where a kid?** Have you thought about when skiing took a different turn and wasn't as fun or gave you the same kind of sensation as it used to do? Have you ever wondered why?

Dealing with injuries and periods with lack of motivation affects our possibility to maximize the moment of skiing down a mountain. Equipment, friends, weather and environment plays definitely a big role in this game but pain, endurance, strength, flexibility and the all combined balance as well as progress in skiing is probably the most significant factors that set limits to having the most awesome day on the mountain and maintain passion and keep on skiing with the biggest smile!

"Rather than treating the symptom, Pimp my skiing, reeducates your body, your brain and make you ski better without any complex or dangerous exercises."

Welcome - Freedom and skiing starts with change....It just started to snow...
