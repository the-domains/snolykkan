However, in many ways it paints a pretty good picture of peoples relation to winter and what kind of "emotions" people like to share and what people identify themselves as.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc8699711961032ca85d0779d1d1d39ee9498e21.jpg"><h2>Reasons to come to Norway</h2><p>Skiing is and has been more than just pleasure. Especially for me. Skiing is not only the joy of sliding down a hill. Skiing has its place in history for exploration, communication and survival. It’s in close relation to myself and the culture I grew up in.</p><p>What would Sweden be like if Gustav Wasa didn’t have skis on his escape from the Danish king? How could Norwegians survive in everyday life without being able to transport themselves on snow? Not to mention, the actions by the heroes of Telemark taking place in Rjukan during the second world war. Some pretty tough skiers.</p><p>If it wasn’t for skis we wouldn’t have been able to discover the true north or south of the planet we live on, and kids would not enjoy winter as much.</p><p>Skiing and the principles of skiing has played a key-role in the development of the society in all Scandinavia but especially Norway.</p><blockquote><p>My question is what happens to history when then global migration, poverty and wars make people head north, meeting a society and a climate where the winter is dark and cold?</p></blockquote><p>If you live in a winter resort like I have and visit a government housing "institution" for immigrants (asylmottak) its not always the most happy place. And specially not during the dark, cold months of the year and without the proper tools for enjoyment during winter. Winter becomes painful, depressive and not to mention long.</p><p>People who enjoy winter have a better life during winter. They automatically enjoys being outside and play in the snow, on the ice or in the water with a wetsuit. But this takes some effort to really learn because its normally from those who have passionate people close, who gets the chance to enjoy.</p><p>Also, kids who go outside, get necessary sunlight, move physically and meet friends for free play with mother nature as boundaries. My experiences as a dad and ski-teacher says that they also get more relaxed and comfortable with the local environment which again lead to creativity and that feeds exploration and curiosity.</p><p>And what would life be without curiosity? If you have an answer, please let me know. Snølykkan is curious about you, wherever you come from.</p><p>Are you curious and want to share?</p><p><a href="https://podio.com/webforms/16550426/1112733">Click here!</a></p><p>Best,</p><p>Pontus, Founder of Snølykkan</p><p>Ps.
